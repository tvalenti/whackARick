# whackARick
A version of the Wes Bos JS30 where I changed the "mole" to randomly change to the list of Rick and Morty images I have in an array. Also added a points system for certain Ricks to pop up.  I did comment all of my additions. I also changed the holes where they pop up as well to animated portals from Rick and Morty.
